My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Motivation

My youtube [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCitt3zFHK2jDetDh6ezI05A) are mostly Screen Recordings with OBS (on Win10).  
I have 2 monitors: the primary display is the notebooks monitor, the secondary display is a big external monitor. I record only the secondary display, so I can have any number of helper programs opened in the first display.  
I code and develop an example project in PowerShell, Debian bash, VSCode and web browser. Before recording I create the example project and iteratively modify it, until I am satisfied.  
Then I copy the code to the side (Display1) and start recording the steps of the project all over again on Display2. Most of the text already exists, so I just need to copy and paste it.  
The traditional Ctrl-c and Ctrl-v approach was cumbersome because I needed to move my mouse from one active window to the other repeatedly. It is bad enough on one display, but with 2 displays it is very, very bad. I needed a better streamlined solution.  

I want to select some text on my Display1, press F3 or F4 and this text will be sent to PowerShell or Debian bash Terminal window on Display2. I would like to see it also like a typing simulation that send keystrokes one by one. It is visually more appealing. Finally I want this window to become active, so I can press Enter to run the command. The mouse does not need to move, it is ready for the next line of code on Display1.  

## Open-source AutoHotkey

I found [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) - automation scripting language for Windows. The scripting language is very weird, but my problem was simple. So I created 2 scripts. I made 2 `ahk` files in notepad. Then I run the script by double-click on the script.

## F3 SendInputToPowerShell

```AutoHotkey
F3::
SendInput ^c
ClipWait
clipboard := clipboard   ; Convert any copied files, HTML, or other formatted text to plain text.
ClipWait
if WinExist("Windows PowerShell"){
    WinActivate ; Use the window found by WinExist.
    Send, %clipboard%
}else{
    MsgBox, PowerShell window Not found
}
```

## F4 SendInputToDebian

```AutoHotkey
F4::
SendInput ^c
ClipWait
clipboard := clipboard   ; Convert any copied files, HTML, or other formatted text to plain text.
ClipWait
if WinExist("luciano@Flex5: ~"){
    WinActivate ; Use the window found by WinExist.
    Send, %clipboard%
}else{
    MsgBox, Debian window Not found
}
```

## open-source free and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful,  
please buy me a beer donating on my [paypal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
